# Discount-Sales
Absolute Java Chp 8 Project 7

Define a class named MultiItemSale that represents a sale of multiple items of 
type Sale given in Display 8.1 (or of the types of any of its descendent classes). 
The class MultiItemSale will have an instance variable whose type is Sale[], 
which will be used as a partially filled array. There will also be another instance 
variable of type int that keeps track of how much of this array is currently used. 
The exact details on methods and other instance variables, if any, are up to you. 
Use this class in a program that obtains information for items of type Sale and of 
type DiscountSale (Display 8.2) and that computes the total bill for the list of 
items sold

Requirement from Professor: 
Your program has to prompt the user for multiple items, each containing a name, 
price, and discount. If the item is named “end”, that denotes the end of the list. If 
the discount is 0, the item is of type Sale; otherwise, it is of type DiscountSale.
Print the total price with discounts applied to 2 places of accuracy. Only one file 
is to be submitted containing a class with a main method.
